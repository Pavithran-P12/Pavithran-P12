        <h1>Privacy Policy for Nocturne: Spin the Bottle</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: [September 25, 2025]</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Pavithran</strong> ("we," "us," or "our") handles information collected from users of the <strong>Nocturne: Spin the Bottle</strong> mobile application (the "App").</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We are committed to collecting only the minimum amount of information necessary to provide and improve the App's core social game experience.</p>
        
        <h3>A. Non-Personal Information (Collected Directly)</h3>
        <p>When you use the App, we collect the following non-personal data necessary for gameplay:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Player Names:</strong> Names or aliases (e.g., "Player 1," "John") input by users to identify participants during a single game session. This data is temporary, stored locally on the device, and is <strong>not</strong> transmitted to our servers or stored after the game session ends.</li>
            <li><strong>Game State Data:</strong> Information about the current state of the game (e.g., the number of players, current category selected, the last question asked). This is also stored locally for the duration of the session only.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Device and Analytics Information (Collected via Third Parties)</h3>
        <p>We use third-party tools to understand how the App is used. These tools may collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> Device type, operating system version, and unique identifiers (such as Advertising IDs).</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Which features are used, how often the app is opened, and crash reports.</li>
            <li><strong>Approximate Geographic Location:</strong> Derived from the device's IP address (not precise GPS data).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
        <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Operate the App:</strong> To manage the game logic, dynamically create the spinning wheel, and serve the correct Truth or Dare questions during a game session.</li>
            <li><strong>To Maintain and Improve the App:</strong> To monitor technical performance, fix crashes, and understand user behavior to inform future content updates and design changes.</li>
            <li><strong>To Ensure Compliance:</strong> To verify compliance with applicable App Store terms and your selected <strong>17+/18+ Age Rating</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h2>
        <p>We <strong>do not</strong> sell, rent, or trade your personal information.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We share non-personal analytics and usage data with third-party service providers strictly for the purpose of helping us operate and analyze the App. These third parties are contractually bound to use the data only as instructed by us.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required to do so by law.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. Advertising and In-App Purchases</h2>
        
        <h3>A. Advertising</h3>
        <p>The App does not currently display third-party advertisements.</p>

        <h3>B. In-App Purchases (IAPs)</h3>
        <p>The App offers in-app purchases (e.g., premium categories). All payment transactions are processed directly by the platform provider (Apple App Store or Google Play Store), and we <strong>do not</strong> collect or store your payment details.</p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>
        <p>The App is designated for <strong>mature users (17+ or 18+)</strong> and is not directed at children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you believe that we may have inadvertently collected information from a child, please contact us immediately at <strong>nosgamesp12@gmail.com</strong>.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>We use commercially reasonable measures to protect the information submitted to us from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage method is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our website/store listing. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
